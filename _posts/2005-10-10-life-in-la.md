# Life in LA

At USC, I often received an e-mail titled Crime Alert from Department of Public Safty. It reported crimes occured or attempted near the campus. News about murder, robbery and burglary seem to be very usual. Cops which is TV show about cops and crimes also shows us how dangerous LA is. It seems to be the city of Lost Angeles, not Los Angeles.

Peace.
