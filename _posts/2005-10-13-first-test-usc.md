# First Test at USC

Today, I took the first mid-term at USC. It was for EE464, â€˜Probability Theory for Engineersâ€™. In fact, it is kinda a basic course in Electrical Engineering and I already took it six! years ago at SNU. However, at that time, I wasnâ€™t good at it and didnâ€™t understand even Bayesâ€™ rule which is one of the most popular, usefule and easist! theories. But now, I am doing very well at the class and get to be confident in probability theory. ðŸ™‚

Anyway, before taking the exam, I was nervous a little bit because it was the first exam at USC and I used to make a lots of mistake in exams. After the exam, I could feel that I failed to get an one-hundred points on itâ€¦ I seemed to get a more than an one-hundred points! because there was an extra credit problem. ðŸ™‚ Yeah, I am bragging~ hehe~ Good night.
