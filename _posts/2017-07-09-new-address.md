# New Address - jeongyoonlee.com

I moved my blog from ethiel.org to jeongyoonlee.com.

I’ve used ethiel.org since 1999. Ethiel (이디엘) was the name of a Christian student club at my high school.

After 18 years of sporadic blogging, I decided to make my blog more personal by using my name as its address.

I also write on kaggler.com. I will continue to write on both.

* kaggler.com covers Kaggle, Data Science and Machine Learning.
* jeongyoonlee.com includes articles from kaggler.com as well as other personal articles.

I plan to post at least one article per week.

If you want to receive updates for either, please subscribe to the blog.

Let’s start the new era. 😎
