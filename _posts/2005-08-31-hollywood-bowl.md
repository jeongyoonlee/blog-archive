# Hollywood Bowl

This picture was taken a few weeks ago at Hollywood Bowl which is one of the largest natural amphitheaters placed on the natural hillsides of Bolton Canyon.
It is the only civilized activity in LA for me to go to concert at Hollywood Bowl.

At that time, there was Sarah Jang(Youngju Jang)’s concert. Even though I wasn’t familiar to her and her music, her performance was so impressive that I couldn’t help keeping an eye on her.
