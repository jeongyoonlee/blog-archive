# Be Filled with the Spirit

After I came to Los Angeles, I have always felt the blessing of God heartfully.
He has led me to graceful places and faithful people.
(JH, DS, SY, GMI, KCCC, GSC, Prof. Schweighofer, Prof. Shin, Elder Kang, …)

When I just followed ways He presented to me, He made me fulfilled with the Holy Spirit.
Praise be to the Lord, God!

I feel that this is the most important moment in my life.
This is the right chance to change myself into a faithful steward and please the Lord.
I do not want to waste this amazing grace or be fluitless with that.
Therefore I have to be careful how I live.
I have to spend more time praying and reading the bible to know what the Lord’s will is.

Be very careful, then, how you live–not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is. Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit. – Ephesians 5:15~18

Show me your ways, O LORD, teach me your paths; guide me in your truth and teach me, for you are God my Savior, and my hope is in you all day long. – Psalms 25:4~5 –
