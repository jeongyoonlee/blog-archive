# Thanksgiving

At the GMI thanksgiving dinner party for international students.
Dinner was great! I should have taken pictures of dessert, too.
For turkey itself, however, I didn’t like it. 🙁



Seongjin, Younghwan, and Chulsung



He was the only ‘available’ guy in our table. 🙂

Today, I attended the GMI dinner party for international students. As last year, dinner and dessert were great. But I really didn’t like turkey. I don’t understand why such a tasteless meat like this could be a main dish for the biggest national holiday. ㅡㅠㅡ;
