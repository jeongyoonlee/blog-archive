In 2018, I will do weight training for the first time in my life. Iâ€™m reading Michael Matthewsâ€™ Bigger Leaner Stronger and will follow his advice on diet and weight training.

In short, it will be:

* High protein, slow carb, and low fat diet rather than no carb diet
* Compound exercises rather than isolation exercises
* HIIT (high intensity interval training) rather than regular cardio

Since I wonâ€™t have time to hit the gym mostly, I will start with bodyweight exercises as follows:

I will report how it goes later.

Happy & healthy new year, everyone! ðŸ’ª
