Used goods:

For example, when I needed a new laptop, I checked up techbargains.com and found 25% off coupon for dell Inspiron laptops and 15% off coupon for dell outlet, then I went to fatwallet.com and clicked a dell link to get 1~3% additional cashback. At the dell website, I ordered a laptop using a 2% cashback creditcard which I had found from bankaholic.com. This ended up like more than $100 of savings.

Another example, I often find a 70% off deal for restaurant.com certificates at dealsea.com, and at restaurant.com, I purchase a 50% off certificate for one of my local restaurants, let’s say Misto Cafe. Then I can have dinner at Misto Cafe at a half price by only additional $3.
