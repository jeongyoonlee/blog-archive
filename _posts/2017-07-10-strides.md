Yesterday, I subscribed to a goal tracking app, Strides at \$39.99 per year. Among hundreds of apps that I use, this is the third most expensive app after Yousician (\$119 per year) and Dropbox (\$99 per year). So, by my standard, it must be very useful.

Strides helps you set and track goals by either the occurrences (e.g. for smoking, smoked or not), target numbers (e.g. for reading, 1 book per month or total of 12 books in 2017), or milestones (e.g. for a website, research, design, development, and launch) over various time intervals.

The first screen is the dashboard that lists all the goals currently being tracked. Once a goal is selected, it shows the trend and progress of the goal based on the tracking method.

I like how simple and straightforward it is. Once downloaded, I was able to use it right away after spending just a couple of minutes.

Strides is available for free up to 10 goals with few limitations on tagging and filtering. Therefore, you can try it out before purchase.

If you canâ€™t measure it, you canâ€™t improve it.

Hope it helps you make improvements on your goals. Good luck! ðŸ˜Ž
