# Buying a used 19â€³ LCD monitor

Itâ€™s LG Flatron 19â€³ L1910S.
I bought it by \$120 from Radiokorea (LA Korean internet community)

As I remembered, at the first time, it was more than \$1,000 in 2004.

As time goes by, the price of electronics always gets lower and lower even though its better performance.

That might be the reason why engineers work hard, and also why I never buy the stock of electronics manufacturing companies.

Anyway, Meredith looks more beautiful on this monitor. ðŸ™‚
