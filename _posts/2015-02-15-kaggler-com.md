# Kaggler.com

I started a new blog, [Kaggler.com](http://kaggler.com/) to write mainly about Data Science competitions at Kaggle.

I’ve enjoyed participating in Kaggle competitions since 2011.  In every competition, I learned new things – new algorithms (Factorization Machine, Follow-the-Regularized-Leader), new tools (Vowpal Wabbit, XGBoost), and/or new domains.  It’s been really helpful for me to be up-to-date in the fast evolving fields of Machine Learning and Data Science.

With Kaggler.com, I’d like to share my learning and experiences with others.  Hope it can be useful to someone.
