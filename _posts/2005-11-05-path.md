# Where To Go

1. To pursue the Ph.D degree at Nicolas’ lab next year or
2. To try to transfer to another better grad schools two year later.

Pros for 1:

+ I can save time to get a Ph.D by applying 1 year earlier than usual.
+ I don’t have to wonder about a funding anymore because Nicolas promised a RA position during Ph.D.
+ Machine Learning and computational neuroscience looks so interesting.
+ I can participate a research very soon and may be able to write a paper.
+ Nicolas seems to be VERY nice and passionate.
+ Members of lab are also nice.

Cons against 1:

* USC doesn’t rank high in computer science or neuroscience.
* In Korea, it is not easy to get a job in neuroscience.

Hmm…
It seems to be better for me to accept the suggestion.
Let’s listen to my Lord.
Thanks.
