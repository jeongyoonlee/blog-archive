Q2 2017 passed by quickly with a couple of major events at work and family, which I will share when things get settled down.

In spite of a challenging schedule, a new goal tracking app, Strides, helped me track the progress of goals easily and keep on track of completing those. Even I added a few new goals for the rest of the year.

# Yearly Goals

* Running 200 miles (50%) – I ran 42 miles in Q2, and 100 miles so far.
