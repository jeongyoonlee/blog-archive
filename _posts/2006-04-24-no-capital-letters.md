# No Capital Letters

i cannot type any big characters at my laptop.
more exactly to say, typing big character gets to be very hard.
because shift-keys don’t work anymore.
i cannot type korean, bracket, question-mark, quotation and so on.

at the first time, i was embarassed and upset about that.
however, now, i found that using only small character is funny. – smiley
every character in a sentence seems to be equal and prudent, even for ‘i’.
doesn’t it look so cute, this tiny little ‘i’ – question

so, from now on, i decide to use only this small ‘i’ instead of a big one and call it prudent i.
hehe.

tiny but certain happiness is all around.
it doesn’t depend on our situation or environment.
i, my little prudent ‘i’, think so. – smiley again.
